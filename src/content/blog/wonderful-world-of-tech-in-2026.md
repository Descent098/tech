Cynicism is the new vouge. I find myself falling into it's tempation far too often. It's very easy to be critical, and very exciting to talk about how horrible things are around us. But, recently I've wanted to take a bit of a step back and look at the broader picture. While there are some depressing aspects to the "tech" space in 2026, there's also a lot to be excited about, and thankful for. I wanted to have a post to collect these ideas, and break up some of the negativity I've probably helped contribute to. Here goes.


## Hardware (TODO)

I would argue that probably since ~2020 I haven't noticed much difference in the "raw performance" of most new hardware. For the first time in my life I feel like the hardware I have now could last me easily another 5-10 years. I got my current GPU because I downsized my PC, otherwise I was happy with my 2070 in terms of performance. Likewise, I feel like I'm at the age where the "hardware honeymoon" phase is over. I don't care about getting new stuff for the sake of the excitement that it's new. If it doesn't serve an explicit purpose I care about now, I don't need it. With that being said there is some incredibly impressive changes happening now that legitimately improve hardware, especially laptops in a way that felt like science fiction to me even 10 years ago.

### Power

I recently have been using my laptop much more. I have a Samsung Book 3 360, which is a relatively new laptop. Since I've been using it more I've had some time to see what modern mobile-class hardware can do. In the past I used to carry a bunch of stuff on the train with me, books, laptop, Nintendo Switch, etc. After some experimenting earlier in the year I found out my phone was powerful enough to do switch emulation, which gave me an interesting idea. I wanted to try to move **everything** over to my laptop. One device for games, media, and everything I needed. To beta test what I would need to buy I took my laptop with me on a christmas trip, expecting to be unable to play games, and get an idea of what class of hardware I would need to buy for this dream to be a reality. I realized however, my laptop as it was, was all I need.

I was able to play tons of games, emulate switch games, and even 3d model/sculpt. Everything was fine on the laptop, and I didn't even notice I was in "quiet" mode until after the 10th day. My thin and light laptop could play whatever games I wanted, and combined with my self-hosted servers and it's nice form factor it worked well as an E-reader, note taker, and art machine. To understand how crazy this is for me, let me take you back in time...

#### Many Moons Ago

When I started with computers I bought a prebuilt system from costco with a i7-2770k (quad core 8 thread CPU from 2011) and 10GB of RAM (weird configuration). After years of working and saving I managed to get a deal on my first system I built, which was a i7-4790k with 16GB of RAM and a GTX 660. I used that system to 3d model ~1500 scenes, and render about the same number of videos. Not long after I got a laptop with an i7-5500U. The next largest upgrade I got was many years later I upgraded to a threadripper 1950x and a GTX 770 which I built years after the CPU came out.

To help visualize here's a table below with some specs:

| CPU | Cores | Threads | Clock Speed (max) | Cache | TDP | Release Year | 
|-----|-------|---------|-------------------|-------|-----|--------------|
| Threadripper 1950x | 16 | 32 | 4 | 32 | 180 | 2017 | 
| i7-4790K | 4 | 8 | 4.4 | 8MB | 88W | 2014 | 
| i7-5500U | 2 | 4 | 3 | 4MB | 15W | 2015 | 

Okay, so for those of you that don't build computers and don't know the hardware the long and short of it is that the threadripper was a massive improvement, one that came at the cost of power. The chip was probably ~3x as powerful as my 4790k (desktop), and ~12x as my 5500U (laptop) at the time while pulling 2x the electricity of my desktop and ~12x the electricity of my laptop. If you wanted speed, you paid for it with electricity.

#### Snap Back to Reality (TODO)

Back to the modern day


Yesterday I had a battery bank with a type C cable that I could plug into my headphones, phone, and laptop, charge all 3, and kept my laptop running for over 18 hours.
